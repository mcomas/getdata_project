Getting and Cleanning Data: Course Project
==========================================

This repository contains a proposal for the course project.

 * `download_extract.R` file contains the script used to retrive the data from the internet. After the script is executed all the files are contained inside the disk inside `UCI HAR Dataset` directory.
 
 * `run_analysis.R` file contains the script used to tidy the dataset. The file is commented in such a way that points 1-5 are solved. Packages `dplyr` and `tidyr` are used to tidy the data.
